## Keep the "why" in mind

Cool videos and curriculum do not a successful youth worker make. However, finding the right tools and materials may make a huge difference when it comes to making a huge difference in your community.

In <em>Deep & Wide</em> Andy Stanley, says it this way:
<blockquote>
    Marry your mission. Date your model. Fall in love with your vision. Stay mildly infatuated with your approach.
</blockquote>

Resources and materials are fleeting, and daresay useless if they do not further the vision of your church. Continue to ask "why", and let that lead you to, "Is this the <strong>best</strong> way to do this?"

## Do I really need to read?

When striving to become a better youth worker, (or person in general) it makes little sense to try and re-create the wheel. Proportionally, it costs minimal time and very little money to invest in your education by reading a book. Remember, there's no need to repeat mistakes committed by those who have gone before you.

<blockquote>
    It is books that are the key to the wide world; if you canâ€™t do anything else, read all that you can.
    <br /> - <strong>Jane Hamilton</strong>
</blockquote>

## Census statistics

Want to get a rough estimate of how many teenagers live in your area?
Use WolframAlpha to calculate by simply replacing "Acworth, GA" with your area.
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+population+ages+12+to+18+cities+within+10+miles+of+Acworth%2C+GA">Teenagers within 10 miles of Acworth, GA</a>

## Time management

We have roughly 300 Wednesday night or Sunday morning services to make a difference in a student's life. Let's manage our time well. Try planning meetings, series and hangouts using Google Calendar and Facebook events.
