## Just quick thought

Cool videos and curriculum do not a successful youth worker make. However, finding the right tools and materials may make a huge difference when it comes to making a huge difference in your community.

In <em>Deep & Wide</em> Andy Stanley, says it this way:
<blockquote>
    Marry your mission. Date your model. Fall in love with your vision. Stay mildly infatuated with your approach.
</blockquote>

Resources and materials are fleeting, and daresay useless if they do not further the vision of your church. Always be ready to ask the question, "Is this the <strong>best</strong> way to do this?"

## Do I really need to read?

When striving to become a better youth worker, (or person in general) it makes little sense to try and re-create the wheel. Proportionally, it costs minimal time and very little money to invest in your education by reading a book. Remember, there's no need to repeat mistakes committed by those who have gone before you.

<blockquote>
    It is books that are the key to the wide world; if you canâ€™t do anything else, read all that you can.
    <br /> - <strong>Jane Hamilton</strong>
</blockquote>
